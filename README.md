# Digital Turbine task
This repository was created in order to run analysis for the target variable `winBid`. The goal is to predict this metrics based on available features.  

## What can be found in the repository
In this repository one can find:
- notebook with the analysis (`notebook.ipynb`)
- file that was used to create an environment (`environment.yml`)
- utils with some helper functions used in the Notebook (`utils.py`)


## Prerequisite
- `mamba` was used to create environment
- code was run using `WSL2` and `VSCode``


Note. Plots for categorical variables are cleared to reduce Notebook size. Same for files with models
